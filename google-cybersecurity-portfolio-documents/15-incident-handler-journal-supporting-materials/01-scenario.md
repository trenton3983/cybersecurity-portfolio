# Incident Handler's Journal Setup

## Activity Overview

In this activity, you will review the details of a **security incident** and document the incident using your **Incident Handler's Journal**. 

You previously learned the importance of **documentation** in the **incident response process** and how an Incident Handler's Journal is used to **record information** about security incidents as they are handled. Throughout this course, you will apply your documentation skills using your journal to record details of security incident scenarios analyzed in course activities.

By the time you complete the course, you will have multiple entries in your journal, providing a helpful reference to recall important **concepts** and **tools**. Later, you can add this document to your **cybersecurity portfolio**, which can be shared with prospective employers or recruiters. 

To review the importance of building a professional portfolio, refer to **Create a Cybersecurity Portfolio**.
