| **The 5 W’s**      | **Who**: An organized group of unethical hackers<br> **What**: A ransomware security incident<br> **Where**: At a health care company<br> **When**: Tuesday 9:00 a.m.<br> **Why**: The incident occurred because unethical hackers accessed the company’s systems via a phishing attack. After gaining access, they launched ransomware, encrypting critical files. The motivation appears to be financial, as a ransom note demanded a large sum of money for the decryption key. |
| **Additional Notes** | - How could the health care company prevent an incident like this from occurring again?<br> - Should the company pay the ransom to retrieve the decryption key? |
