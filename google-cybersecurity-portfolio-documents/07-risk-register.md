# Scenario

In this activity, you will **practice performing a risk assessment** by evaluating vulnerabilities that commonly threaten business operations. You will then **prioritize resources** based on the **risk scores** you assign each vulnerability.

The purpose of a security plan is to prepare for risks. Risk assessment is a foundational step of the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**, a voluntary framework of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk. Risk assessments help security teams determine whether their operations are sufficiently prepared to prevent cyberattacks and protect sensitive information.

You‚Äôve joined a new cybersecurity team at a **commercial bank**, which is currently conducting a risk assessment of its operational environment. As part of this assessment, the team is building a **risk register** to focus on the most vulnerable risks.

A risk register is a central record of potential risks to an organization's **assets, systems, and data**. It is a common tool used in cybersecurity assessments.

Your supervisor has asked you to:

- Evaluate a set of risks recorded in the register.
- Determine the **likelihood** of each risk occurring.
- Determine the **severity** of each risk‚Äôs impact.
- Calculate an **overall risk score** for each.
- Use these scores to help **prioritize team efforts**.

# Completed Risk Register

## Operational Environment

The bank is located in a coastal area with low crime rates. It employs 100 on-premise staff and 20 remote workers, increasing the potential for phishing and remote compromise. The customer base is large, with 2,000 individual and 200 commercial accounts, creating a significant data protection responsibility. Services are marketed by a sports team and 10 local businesses, adding third-party exposure. Strict financial regulations mandate daily cash reserves, making operational continuity critical.

## Risk Evaluation Table

| Asset | Risk(s)                   | Description                                                    | Likelihood | Severity | Priority |
|-------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------|----------|----------|
| Funds | Business email compromise | An employee is tricked into sharing confidential information.  | 3          | 3        | 9        |
| Funds | Compromised user database | Customer data is poorly encrypted.                             | 2          | 3        | 6        |
| Funds | Financial records leak    | A database server of backed-up data is publicly accessible.    | 3          | 3        | 9        |
| Funds | Theft                     | The bank's safe is left unlocked.                              | 1          | 3        | 3        |
| Funds | Supply chain disruption   | Delivery delays due to natural disasters.                      | 2          | 2        | 4        |

## Notes

The bank‚Äôs digital infrastructure and remote workforce increase susceptibility to phishing and human error, elevating the risk of business email compromise and database breaches. Public exposure from partnerships and marketing expands the attack surface for threats like data leaks. Natural hazards in the coastal area, though infrequent, could disrupt supply chains. Financial records and physical cash management are subject to federal compliance, magnifying the impact of security breaches in those areas.
