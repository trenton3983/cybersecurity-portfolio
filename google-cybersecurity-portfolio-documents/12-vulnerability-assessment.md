# Vulnerability Assessment Report  
**Date:** 1st January 20XX

## System Description

The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs on the latest version of the Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management system. It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.

This database server supports remote employee access, enabling global staff to query customer and business data critical for daily operations. However, the server is currently open to public access, increasing its exposure to external threats and significantly expanding its attack surface.

## Scope

This vulnerability assessment focuses exclusively on the access controls of the publicly available database server. The scope does not include physical security or connected IT systems. The assessment covers the period from June 20XX to August 20XX and adheres to the risk analysis framework provided in *NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1*.

The primary goals are to evaluate threats to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data stored in the database and to recommend actionable remediation strategies.

## Purpose

This assessment was conducted to evaluate the risks posed by the current configuration of the publicly accessible database server. The server is a mission-critical component of business operations, providing global employees with access to essential customer data.

If this server were compromised or disabled, the company could suffer major disruptions in operations, financial losses, and reputational damage. Furthermore, unauthorized access to sensitive information could lead to regulatory penalties and erosion of customer trust. Securing this system is vital to maintaining operational continuity and business resilience.

## Risk Assessment

| Threat Source                | Threat Event                                     | Likelihood (1–3) | Severity (1–3) | Risk (L × S = R) |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------|----------------|------------------|
| Hacker (unauthorized outsider) | Obtain sensitive information via exfiltration | 3                | 3              | 9                |
| Remote employee (human error) | Accidental misconfiguration of access permissions | 2             | 2              | 4                |
| Advanced persistent threat (APT) | Launch Distributed Denial of Service (DoS) attack | 2            | 3              | 6                |

## Approach

This vulnerability assessment was conducted using a **qualitative method** based on guidance from *NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1*. The threats selected represent the most likely and impactful risks to the current database setup:

- A **hacker** could exploit the server’s public access to exfiltrate sensitive data, presenting the highest risk due to ease of access and potential business damage.
- A **remote employee**, due to human error, might accidentally misconfigure access settings, leaving the server exposed or improperly secured.
- An **advanced persistent threat (APT)** could execute a DoS attack, disrupting business operations and impacting customer experience.

*Likelihood* scores were assigned by assessing the motivation and capability of each threat actor. *Severity* scores reflect the level of disruption each event could cause to critical business functions. This assessment assumes no prior incident data and relies on expert judgment and standard risk modeling.

## Remediation Strategy

To reduce or eliminate the risks identified in this assessment, the following technical and operational controls are recommended:

- **Restrict public access:** Remove public-facing permissions and implement VPN or IP allowlisting for employee connections.
- **Enforce the principle of least privilege:** Ensure employees have only the minimum access necessary for their roles. Role-based access controls (RBAC) should be configured within the database.
- **Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA):** Require MFA for all users accessing the system to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised.
- **Implement the AAA framework (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting):** Monitor all access attempts and maintain detailed logs to audit activity and identify anomalies.
- **Deploy DoS protection tools:** Use intrusion prevention systems (IPS), firewalls, and rate-limiting to detect and mitigate flood attacks in real time.

Implementing these measures will reduce the attack surface, enhance data protection, and improve the overall security posture of the organization’s infrastructure.
