## Risk Assessment

### Risk Description

Currently, there is inadequate management of assets. Additionally, Botium Toys does not have all the proper controls in place and may not be fully compliant with U.S. and international regulations and standards.

### Control Best Practices

The first of the five functions of the NIST CSF is **Identify**.  
Botium Toys will need to dedicate resources to identify assets so they can appropriately manage them. Additionally, they will need to classify existing assets and determine the impact of the loss of existing assets, including systems, on business continuity.

### Risk Score

- **Risk Level:** 8 out of 10 (**High**)  
- This high score is due to a lack of controls and adherence to compliance best practices
