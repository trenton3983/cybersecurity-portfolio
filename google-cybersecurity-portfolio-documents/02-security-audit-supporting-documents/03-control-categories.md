# Control Categories

Controls within cybersecurity are grouped into three main categories:

- **Administrative/Managerial controls**
- **Technical controls**
- **Physical/Operational controls**

## Administrative/Managerial Controls

These controls address the **human component** of cybersecurity. They include policies and procedures that define how an organization manages data and clearly define employee responsibilities, including their role in protecting the organization.

While administrative controls are typically policy-based, the enforcement of those policies may require the use of **technical** or **physical controls**.

## Technical Controls

These consist of solutions such as:

- Firewalls  
- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)  
- Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)  
- Antivirus (AV) products  
- Encryption  

Technical controls can be used in a variety of ways to meet organizational goals and objectives.

## Physical/Operational Controls

These include:

- Door locks  
- Cabinet locks  
- Surveillance cameras  
- Badge readers  

These are used to limit physical access to assets by unauthorized personnel.

## Control Types

Control types include, but are not limited to:

- **Preventative**
- **Corrective**
- **Detective**
- **Deterrent**

These controls work together to provide **defense in depth** and protect assets:

- **Preventative controls** are designed to stop incidents from occurring.
- **Corrective controls** restore assets after an incident.
- **Detective controls** identify whether an incident has occurred or is in progress.
- **Deterrent controls** discourage attacks.
