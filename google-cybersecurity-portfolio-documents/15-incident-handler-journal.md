| **Description**        | A small healthcare clinic in the U.S. experienced a ransomware attack that encrypted critical medical records and disrupted business operations. The attack began with a phishing email that successfully deployed malware and ransomware onto employee computers, leading to a system shutdown and a ransom demand by the attackers. |
| **Tool(s) Used**       | No specific tools were identified in the scenario. However, in a real-world response, tools like **email filters**, **endpoint detection and response (EDR) software**, **SIEM platforms**, and **forensic analysis tools** would likely be used to investigate and contain the incident. |
| **The 5 W's**          | - **Who caused the incident?**<br> An organized group of unethical hackers specifically targeting the healthcare and transportation sectors orchestrated the attack.<br><br> - **What happened?**<br> A phishing email with a malicious attachment was used to deploy malware, followed by ransomware, which encrypted essential files and displayed a ransom note on affected systems.<br><br> - **When did the incident occur?**<br> The incident occurred on Tuesday at approximately 9:00 a.m., affecting systems early in the clinic's workday.<br><br> - **Where did the incident occur?**<br> The attack took place at a small healthcare clinic in the United States, impacting multiple employee workstations and operational infrastructure.<br><br> - **Why did the incident happen?**<br> The incident occurred due to social engineering tactics (phishing) that exploited human vulnerability and a lack of adequate email security or endpoint protections, allowing malware to be downloaded and ransomware to be executed. |
| **Additional Notes**   | - This scenario highlights the critical importance of cyber hygiene training, robust email filtering, and regular system backups.<br> - It underscores how targeted attacks on critical sectors like healthcare can severely impact public services.<br> - **Questions raised:**<br> What steps were taken post-incident to prevent recurrence?<br> Was the ransom paid?<br> How was the data recovered? |
| **Reflections/Notes**  | - This exercise reinforced the value of real-time documentation and structured analysis when responding to incidents.<br> - Practicing the **5 W‚Äôs** approach helps in clear, concise communication, which is especially critical during high-pressure response scenarios.<br> - It also serves as a reminder to advocate for employee phishing awareness training and incident response planning as part of an organization‚Äôs cybersecurity framework. |
