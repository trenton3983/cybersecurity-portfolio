# Scenario

In this activity, you will classify assets connected to a **home office network**.

Asset management is a critical part of every organization's security plan. It involves tracking assets and the **risks** that affect them. Effective asset management begins with creating an **asset inventory**â€”a catalog of assets that need protection. Afterward, you classify assets based on their **importance** and **sensitivity** to risk.

**Be sure to complete this activity before moving on.** The next course item will provide a completed exemplar to compare with your work.

## Instructions

One of the most valuable assets in the world today is **information**. Most information is accessed over a **network**. Networks typically have a variety of **connected devices**, each serving as a potential **entry point** to other assets.

An **inventory of network devices** is a useful tool for asset management. It helps identify **sensitive assets** that may need additional protection.

You are operating a **small business from your home** and must create an **inventory of your network devices**. This inventory will help you determine which devices contain **sensitive information** and require extra protection.

### Step 1: Identify Devices

Start by identifying **three devices** that have access to your home network. These might include:

- Desktop or laptop computers  
- Smartphones  
- Smart home devices  
- Game consoles  
- Storage devices or servers  
- Video streaming devices  

### Step 2: List Device Characteristics

For each device, list the following characteristics:

- **Owner**  
- **Location**  
- **Type**  

### Step 3: Assign Sensitivity Level

Finally, assign each device a **level of sensitivity** based on how important it is to protect.

# Completed Home Office Asset Inventory

| Asset                    | Network Access | Owner     | Location     | Notes                                                                 | Sensitivity   |
|-------------------------|----------------|-----------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Smart TV                | Occasional     | Homeowner | Living room  | Streams content via Wi-Fi; no local storage but has third-party apps. | Internal-only |
| External Hard Drive (NAS) | Continuous   | Homeowner | Home office  | Stores backup files including financial documents; connected via LAN. | Restricted    |
| Smart Thermostat        | Continuous     | Homeowner | Hallway      | Controls HVAC system; connected to network via 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi.         | Confidential  |

## Explanation of Sensitivity Classifications

- **Smart TV**: Although connected to the internet, it stores minimal data and poses lower risk. Classified as *Internal-only* due to its on-premises use.
- **External Hard Drive (NAS)**: Contains sensitive backups (e.g., tax returns, personal files). Classified as *Restricted* because access should be strictly need-to-know.
- **Smart Thermostat**: Could provide insight into occupancy patterns or be used to disrupt comfort/security. Classified as *Confidential* since it should be accessible only to specific users.
